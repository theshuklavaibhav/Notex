## 🧑‍💻 Code Highlights

- **Provider Pattern:**  
  All note operations (add, delete) are managed by a single provider, ensuring a scalable and maintainable codebase.

- **Stateless & Stateful Widgets:**  
  Uses StatelessWidget for static screens and StatefulWidget where state needs to be managed (e.g., text controllers).

- **UI/UX:**  
  Clean, modern Material Design with clear call-to-action buttons and feedback for empty states.
